# Implementation Report: Phase 4 â€“ Admin Interface
Date: 2025-09-12
PRD: 001-rails-time-04.prd.md

## Phases Completed
- [x] Admin roles & authorization
  - Migration `add_role_to_users` with default `user` and index
  - `User` enum roles with `admin?` helper
  - `AdminAuthorization` concern with `before_action :require_admin`
- [x] Admin Users CRUD (read, delete) + role toggle
  - `Admin::UsersController` with `index/show/destroy/toggle_role`
  - Filtering by email and role; simple pagination (25/page)
  - Turbo Stream updates for row replace/remove
- [x] Layout & Views
  - Minimal `layouts/admin` using existing terminal theme
  - Views: `admin/users/index`, `_user_row`, `show`
- [x] Routes
  - `namespace :admin` with users routes and `toggle_role` member action; admin root

## Testing Summary
- Manual verification:
  - Non-admin redirected from `/admin` to home with Access denied
  - Admin can see users, filter by email/role, toggle role, and delete (except self)
  - Turbo updates refresh just the changed row or remove it

## Security Notes
- Authorization guard prevents non-admin access
- Self-protection: cannot delete or change own role

## Next Steps
- Add pagination gem (kaminari or pagy) if needed later
- Add system tests for admin flows
- Hook flash partials for admin layout and add breadcrumbs
