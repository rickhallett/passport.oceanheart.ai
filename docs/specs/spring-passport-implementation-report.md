- Tests passing: 0
- Manual verification: Ready for testing (requires Java runtime)

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Rails-Compatible JWT Implementation
**Problem**: Ensuring 100% JWT token compatibility between Spring and Rails implementations.
**Solution**: Used exact same HS256 algorithm, payload structure, and token expiration as Rails implementation.

### Challenge 2: Glass Morphism UI Translation
**Problem**: Translating Rails ERB templates with Tailwind CSS to Thymeleaf templates.
**Solution**: Created CSS-only glass morphism implementation with identical visual styling and terminal aesthetics.

### Challenge 3: Spring Security Configuration
**Problem**: Configuring Spring Security to work with both JWT tokens and session cookies.
**Solution**: Implemented custom JWT authentication filter that handles both Bearer tokens and HTTP-only cookies.

### Challenge 4: CSRF Protection
**Problem**: Balancing CSRF protection for HTML forms while allowing API access.
**Solution**: Configured CSRF tokens for HTML endpoints while disabling for API endpoints.

## Critical Security Notes
- JWT secret must match Rails implementation for SSO compatibility
- Cookie domains must be `.oceanheart.ai` for production
- BCrypt strength must be 12 to match Rails password hashing
- CSRF tokens must be properly configured for HTML forms

## Next Steps
- Test application with Java runtime environment
- Implement Phase 4: Admin interface and rate limiting
- Add unit and integration tests
- Create database migrations with Flyway
- Docker containerization for deployment
