# Implementation Report: Passport Lite (Pure Bun)
## Date: 2025-09-18
## PRD: passport-lite/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

## Executive Summary
Implementation of a lightweight, high-performance authentication service using Bun's native APIs, providing feature parity with the Rails-based Passport system.

## Phases Completed
- [ ] Phase 1: Core Authentication
  - Tasks: Project setup, database schema, user model, JWT service, basic API endpoints
  - Commits: (pending)
- [ ] Phase 2: Web Interface
  - Tasks: TSX views, web routes, session management, CSRF protection, cookie handling
  - Commits: (pending)
- [ ] Phase 3: Admin & Security
  - Tasks: Admin interface, rate limiting, password reset, session tracking, logging
  - Commits: (pending)
- [ ] Phase 4: Testing & Deployment
  - Tasks: Unit tests, integration tests, performance optimization, deployment config
  - Commits: (pending)

## Testing Summary
- Tests written: 0
- Tests passing: 0
- Manual verification: pending

## Architecture Decisions
- Runtime: Bun 1.1+ for native TypeScript support
- Database: bun:sqlite for development, PostgreSQL-ready for production
- Authentication: Argon2id (via Bun.password) replacing BCrypt
- JWT: HS256 algorithm using native crypto APIs
- UI: TSX server-side rendering with glass morphism styling
- Zero npm dependencies for core functionality

## Performance Targets
- Startup Time: ~50ms (40x improvement over Rails)
- Memory Usage: ~30MB (5x reduction)
- Request Latency: ~2ms (7.5x faster)
- Throughput: ~50k req/s (10x improvement)

## Security Features
- Argon2id password hashing (more secure than BCrypt)
- HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite cookies
- CSRF token validation
- Rate limiting per IP and route
- Prepared statements for SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection in TSX templates

## Challenges & Solutions
- (To be documented during implementation)

## Critical Security Notes
- Authentication/Authorization changes: Migrating from BCrypt to Argon2id
- Data validation changes: TypeScript type safety throughout
- Input sanitization: Built into TSX templating

## Next Steps
- Begin Phase 1 implementation
- Set up development environment
- Create initial project structure
